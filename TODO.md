# NVIM Config

This document outlines my ongoing journey with a ideal neovim setup. 
In an attempt to get better at using the CLI to manage, find and write code - 
I will be switching over to nvim for some personal projects.

It has long been a intention of mine to get more comfortable and flexible with my CLI environment. 
This repo will serve as a rekindling of my bare love of coding, and I will be working to update this config with the minimal possible set of tools to efficiently code.
