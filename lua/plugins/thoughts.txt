Everything is okay.
It will be okay with work.
You have lots of money and lots of people to support you.
It isn't the same as last time -- not by a long shot.
You need to be calm, safe and supportive. You are not being that way right now.
You aren't any use to anyone like this. You need to calm down. You need to be a rock. You've gotta be solid.
Put yourself aside. 
Put your anxiety aside. 
Get rid of it. 
You don't need it. 
Things will work out fine. 
You are looking for things to be anxious about. 
Because you are surprised at how happy you are and how stable you feel. 
Because you have so much to grateful for. 
You've got this, you aren't a fuckup.
You aren't all mentally ill and hopeless.
You aren't some obsessive loser that can't feel empathy.
You're a strong, stable and patient father that is expanding his family.
You are proud of yourself for supporting them and for being there for them.
You are present and giving and generous with your emotions with them.
The effort that you put into these things is worth it. 
It's okay to be unsure about things sometimes. 
You are human and you have emotions and they are yours. 
The reason Jessie wanted to do this with you is that you are a good father and good partner to her.
You are embracing this life and it is embracing you.
This embrace makes you whole, it does not suffocate you.
This embrace allows you to feel.
She is accepting of you and loves you for who you are
She has her eyes open and does not project onto you.
